# Metaprogramming Conclusion

From the last few labs, we can see Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities. 
Metaprogramming allows for efficiency, which will be needed as we scale
up to building larger applications.

We discussed concepts such as: 

* How mass assignment works
* Creating custom errors
* Using Ruby's metaprogramming features

With this technique, we're able to write code that is DRYer, lighter,
more intuitive and more scalable. Although other languages can do this,
we can save a lot more time using Ruby.
